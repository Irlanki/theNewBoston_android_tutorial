Hi all,

I'm  just learning android from the awesome tutorials made by Travis (available for FREE at ) and decided to code them in hand. Just pushing them to this repo if anyone needs them.

One interesting point, I'll make a commit after every tutorial! So you can browse the snapsot of each tutorial by selecting previous commits! Cool, huh? (The initial commit begins with tutorial#10, though)

So if you know how to browse through different commits of a git repository (they are basically nothing, consider them as many diffferent versions) you can get codes of literally all tutorials. The commit message will help you.

Regards,
